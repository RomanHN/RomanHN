# Hi, my name’s Roman!

I’m an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas and the president of Effective Altruism UTD: a student group that aims to help students use the principles of [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) to have a greater positive impact on the world using their career.

I want to work full-time solving the world’s most important and neglected problems and ensure humanity has a long and flourishing future. In particular, I’m pursuing technical research into [ensuring the safety of powerful AI systems](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/).
